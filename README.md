# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-of-Vehicle-Fuel-Types-and-Driven-Kilometers
This project presents an exploratory analysis of a vehicle dataset, investigating the correlation between different fuel types and the distances driven. 

Leveraging Python's Pandas and Matplotlib libraries, I created visualizations such as histograms and pie charts to illustrate the distribution of kilometers covered by vehicles based on their fuel types. Through these visual insights, I aimed to uncover patterns and preferences associated with fuel selection and how they relate to the traveled distances.

This analysis is a result of my participation in the "Data Science and Artificial Intelligence" training program offered by Code23. The project was conducted within the scope of this comprehensive training, which provided an opportunity to enhance my data analysis and visualization skills.
